# Bus Ticket Reservation System Using C Language
*In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the course Computer Programming 2*

The Bus Ticket Reservation System is an application that allows passengers to view bus schedules, reserve bus seats a day beforehand, print tickets and receipts and cancel reservations. It is intended to make it easier to book bus tickets in small bus terminals, therefore eliminating long queues and other difficulties associated with manual reservations. Passengers can also check each bus's availability and fare.

This project's objective is to generate a ticket reservation system for a small bus terminal company. It seeks to remove the time-consuming manual reservation process and to prevent the formation of long passenger queues. It also seeks to improve bus terminal operators' service quality by reducing human mistakes and misunderstandings caused by manual reservation systems.
